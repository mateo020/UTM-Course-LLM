Cinema Studies - Major (Arts): Cinema Studies - Major (Arts) The Cinema Studies program is devoted to the stylistic, historical, and theoretical analysis of film. Students learn about film as a unique mode of communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, while also investigating what it is that film can be said to share with allied art forms. Surveys of major world cinemas and oeuvres, and courses on particular genres and forms, introduce students to a range of cinematic traditions and practices. Throughout the program, students consider the impact moving images have on personal and cultural identities and on society in general, and engage with questions about the relation between aesthetics and politics. The Cinema Studies program develops students’ visual analysis, critical thinking, and writing skills, which are relevant to many different possible careers.

Creative Writing - Minor (Arts): Creative Writing - Minor (Arts) The Department of English and Drama’s Minor in Creative Writing is designed to allow students to focus on either the literary or dramatic arts, or to integrate their work in both these areas of creative expression. In lectures and tutorials in two courses at the 200 level, they will learn about the artistic traditions that frame their own writing; and experiment with producing and sharing written work in a variety of genres, using a range of formal techniques. These introductory courses serve as a foundation for 300-level workshops, in which students develop a more specialised focus, e.g. playwriting, prose fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, editing, or writing for interactive new media. Finally, all students in the Minor can apply for admittance to the department's selective, 400-level capstone Creative Writing Workshop, in which over the course of a year they will be encourage to develop their portfolio of creative work towards publication. When students graduate with a Minor in Creative Writing they will have learned to use language creatively to develop observations, insights, and complex ideas. They will be able to write imaginatively, compellingly, clearly, and effectively, and to produce creative work in a range of literary and dramatic modes, genres, and forms. Courses in the Minor emphasize the way that how writers learn their craft from other writers, and the ways in which new modes of written expression emerge in the context of artistic tradition and historical circumstances. The Minor will also introduce students to the processes involved in editing and publishing creative work in print and other media. Completion Requirements: 4.0 credits are required.

Theatre and Drama Studies - Specialist (Arts): Theatre and Drama Studies - Specialist (Arts) The study of Theatre, Drama and Performance examines the relationship between the artists who create written texts intended for production, the artists who turn scripts into performances, and the audiences who experience the resulting theatrical event. It is the study of the event itself and the acts of creation involved in producing that event. Theatre, Drama and Performance involves the study of plays, actors, directors, theatres, designers, and audiences from the classical stage to contemporary plays and performances from around the world. The focus of Theatre, Drama and Performance Studies at U of T Mississauga, both curricular and extra-curricular, is the Erindale Studio Theatre and the Multi-Media Studio Theatre in the CCT Building (or MiST). The Erindale Studio Theatre is used for performances of Theatre Erindale, the production company of the Specialist Program, and for performances of the English and Drama Student Society (EDSS). MiST is used for teaching and co-curricular and extra-curricular performances by all programs. We also have several rehearsal halls in Deerfield Hall that are used for classes, performances, and other program activities. Courses in related topics are given in many disciplines. A list of these courses is given in the general notes for All Programs below and students interested in the field are advised to consider taking some of them. == The Specialist Honours Program in Theatre & Drama Studies, offered jointly with Sheridan College, involves the study of plays, actors, theatres, designers and audiences from the classical stage to contemporary plays and performances from around the world. We give students the opportunity to earn a two-year (equivalent) conservatory diploma in professional actor training from Sheridan within a Specialist degree in performance history and theory and dramatic literature from U of T Mississauga. This high-powered combined program prepares students for a career on the stage or behind the scenes in the professional theatre world, or for drama teaching at the high school or university level. Enrolment Requirements: Limited Enrolment — Enrolment in this program is limited to students who are successful in an audition, conducted in the spring of each year. For audition requirements, please see the website www.utm.utoronto.ca/reg/audition . Enrolment in all studio courses (DRS) is restricted to students in the Specialist Program. Students applying to proceed to the second year of the Theatre and Drama Studies program must have completed 4.0 credits with a minimum CGPA of 2.0. TDS students must enroll in the Specialist Subject POSt at the end of the first year. Check your email and ACORN for further information about your Subject POSt or contact your undergraduate advisor.

ENG100H5 does not count toward the TDS Specialist program. DRE201H5 is not intended for Specialists and does not count towards program requirements. "Taking a year off" from this program is possible, if difficult, after the first and second year, problematic and nearly impossible after the third year. Returning at any point requires consultation with the Director of Drama Studies at UTM and the Program Coordinator at Sheridan College and also depends on the availability of space in the class you wish to join. Likewise, students considering time away should also consult the Director of Drama Studies at UTM and the Program Coordinator at Sheridan College. ERSPE1880
