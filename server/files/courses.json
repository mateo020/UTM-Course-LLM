With this background in place we will proceed to consider the various ways in which the question of how one should live has been answered across of a range of social settings.

While we will examine classic examples of hunter-gatherer groups, early villages, urban settlements, regional polities, and large empires through time, we will also stress the contemporaneity of groups of people with very different lifestyles -- hunter-gatherers participated in trading networks with town and city dwellers, pastoral nomads moved through settled village regions during their annual migrations. The impact of archaeological research on the region today is seen through the politicization of South Asian prehistory and history that has strongly affected both interpretations of the past and modern political events.

This course explores \"the city\" through a multispecies lens and challenges assumptions about the human-centeredness (anthropocentrism) of urban places. In this course students are invited to utilize a variety of approaches, including arts-based ethnography, journaling, archival research, photography, sound-scaping, et al., as we explore the following questions: How do ideas about nature-culture shape our interactions with nonhumans in cities? How do built environments structure human-nonhuman relationships in urban spaces? How have human-nonhuman interactions changed over time in cities? How can we foster more compassionate and caring relationships with nonhumans in cities - and how might we do this in the context of social-ecological injustices and climate change? What might a thriving multispecies city of the future look like?",

It traces the historical development of the powerful biomedical paradigm that dominates health research today and uses a critical lens to examine the systems used to measure and classify health and disease. It explores evolutionary and biological approaches to understanding human health by examining the concepts of adaptation and plasticity, genetic and epigenetic approaches, developmental origins and life history theories, social determinants of health, and critical medical anthropology. The course explores the profoundly influential role of social inequality on the production and reproduction of health in historical and contemporary populations.",

Their efforts have yielded dividends: key insights into some of today\u2019s most pressing problems, as well as new analytic tools with which to capture them. This fourth-year seminar will enable students to survey a range of pressing contemporary concerns and to explore some of the ways anthropologists and cognate scholars are engaging with them. Because anthropology is part of the world it seeks to understand, the seminar will also consider anthropology\u2019s own grounds of knowledge, dwelling on some of the epistemological, ethical and political conundrums the discipline\u2019s real-world entanglements entail. This concern takes us beyond \u201ctroubled times,\u201d inviting reflection on that curious Western project we call \u201canthropology.\u201d",

Focusing on the pre- and early modern periods, the course asks the question--what material substances and objects do people use to share imaginative stories? And, what difference can knowing about these make to the history of literature, including literatures in English? The course is partly experiential and collaborative in design. We will learn from one or more present-day book makers: e.g. an Ojibwe maker of birch bark scrolls; or a modern parchment maker or bookbinder. We will visit the Fisher Rare Book Library to see, among others books, one made in 1474 by William Caxton, England\u2019s first printer. And we will collaborate with students working in Forensic Science and Chemistry to use scientific techniques--from advanced microscopy to x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy--to develop and answer humanistic questions about books: e.g. Where did book makers obtain their materials? How have book making technologies--and with them literary texts and traditions--travelled around the globe? What evidence have readers of old books left behind? Underpinning the course is a critical approach to the so-called \u201cToronto School\u201d--that is, \u201cthe theory of the primacy of communication in the structuring of human cultures and the structuring of the human mind.\u201d Is the work of e.g. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan relevant to the 21st study of literature? What messages are still readable in the media used by the literary communities of the past?",

Starting with the emergence of phantasmagoric visual entertainments (ca. 1800), this course reviews this rich and fascinating history in Europe and North America but also with a few non-Western cultural examples (e.g., Japan, Philippines) focusing on key case studies in spirit photographic practice. The course considers various reasons why people have wanted to believe in the veracity of these phenomena (e.g., followers of the religious movement of Spiritualism) as well as why others have wanted to debunk spirit photography as a hoax or fraud (e.g., Harry Houdini and P.T. Barnum).

We will be concerned with the manifold appearances of uprooted objects, new arrangements, and the invisible layers of skill, materials, and manufacture that resulted from heightened exchange. Objects of study will range broadly: porcelain, tableware and foodstuffs, screens and silver, naturalia and their elaborate mounts, miniatures, prints and books, paintings (Dutch Still Life, Las Meninas) which put the world of things on display.",

It compares Western landscape painting traditions with visual forms from other traditions that could be seen as \"landscapes,\" but might be based on very different ideas. These include Indigenous art from Canada, as well as East and South Asian forms.Understanding these multiple traditions equips students fora more globally oriented, historically informed, and critical approach to modern and contemporary art concerned with the environment and our existence in the geological age lately dubbed the Anthropocene. The seminar readings provide the basis for final research papers pertaining to the broad theme of landscape or eco-aesthetics in modern or contemporary art, as well as in other image practices across a range of global traditions.",

During the Fall semester, you will attend two 1-hour PHL103H/PHL113H lectures each week, and teach one tutorial of 20-25 students, meeting with them for 1 hour each week. You will grade their papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed. You will be paid for approximately 100 hours of work each semester, for a total of 200 hours, at the current hourly wage for CUPE Unit 1. The second component of the course is a seminar that meets once per week for 3 hours each time, during the fall term. Most of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL103H/PHL113H; but you will also discuss the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy-grading papers, prompting and guiding discussion, and so forth. Third, during the winter term you will write a seminar paper, on a topic of your choosing, under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also present your work orally at an undergraduate research conference held jointly with the Socrates students from the St. George campus.

Students will also be exposed to general theories of culture and the social construction of memory, and will be trained in qualitative methods, with a focus on basic field observation and field note writing. Students will take this knowledge and training into the field, using a sociological lens to look at genocide museums and memorials, and the people who visit them. The course will culminate in a final project based on the students' observations and analysis during one of several course field trips. The specific cultural and historical sites for the course will vary from year to year. As part of this course, students may have the option of participating in an international learning experience that will have an additional cost and application process.

More recently the humanities have been described as taking an \u201canimal turn,\u201d influenced by posthumanist thought and the idea that we are living in a period of unprecedented human impact on the planet, commonly (yet controversially) known as the Anthropocene. How has visual culture studies developed on or challenged Berger\u2019s insights since he wrote that essay? Building on critiques of the category of \u201cnature\u201d as something that somehow pre-exists \u201cculture\u201d and is outside of it, which in turn challenges the terms of our distinctions between humans and animals, how does recent scholarship approach the place of images and vision in human-animal relations, and indeed the very idea of the animal itself?This seminar investigates these questions through texts that discuss key theoretical questions and examine representations of animals across a variety of media, species, historical or geographical contexts, and disciplinary approaches.",
